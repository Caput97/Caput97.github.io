Hi there! I’m Davide Testa, an __Artificial Intelligence__ and Natural Language Processing (__NLP__) enthusiast. I’m a __computational linguist__ who has blended his passion for linguistics with the love for the digital world and computer science. For this reason, one adjective that perfectly describes my academic journey is 'transversal'.

Currently, I'm completing my __PhD in AI__, exploring the fascinating world of __multimodality__ and the intersection of vision and language in large multimodal models. My research focuses on the challenges of __visual reasoning__ and __grounding__, aiming to improve AI systems' ability to understand and interact with the world in meaningful ways.

Beyond my research, I firmly believe in the power of __curiosity__, __creativity__, and __inclusivity__. I embrace a diverse and open-minded approach to both my work and life, and I am a proud ally and activist of the LGBTQ+ community. I thrive in environments where everyone feels empowered to explore, learn, and contribute—whether through technical work or sharing ideas and passions.

When I’m not immersed in code, papers, and models you’ll likely find me cooking or baking cakes and listening to music. I also enjoy traveling, discovering new places and cultures, having fun with my friends, and hitting the dance floor.


This blog is where I share both my academic journey and personal reflections, hoping to connect with others who share similar passions.
Feel free to reach out—whether you're curious about AI, have ideas to share, or just want to chat. I'm always open to learning from others and exchanging ideas!
