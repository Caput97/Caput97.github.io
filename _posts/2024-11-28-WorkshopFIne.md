It was an incredible experience, full of emotions and discoveries. I had the chance to share the work behind MAIA, my PhD project on benchmarking VLMs, and engage in insightful discussions with experts in the field at the first FINE Workshop co-located in the AixiA Conference 2024.

A special thanks to the workshop organizers for the invitation, my supervisors for the support, and everyone who attended, making this day truly unforgettable. 🙏

I’m excited to continue this journey and take on new challenges in the world of research. 🚀
