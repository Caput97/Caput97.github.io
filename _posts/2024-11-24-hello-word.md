Welcome to my space on the web! 🌟

This blog is where I’ll be sharing my journey through Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, and related fields. It’s a place for me to document ideas, discuss projects, and showcase achievements (big and small). 
You can expect:
- Reflections on NLP, AI, and their ever-evolving landscape.
- Updates on my publications, research projects, and milestones.

I believe in the power of curiosity, diversity, and the freedom to explore ideas without boundaries.
Thus, I want this to be a space for anyone who’s passionate about AI or simply curious about new ideas, and I hope it sparks meaningful conversations and connections.

Feel free to explore, share your thoughts, or just say hi.
More updates are coming soon! 🌈
